      <h2>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h2>

      <p><b>What is a place holder ?</b></p>
      <p>
        The 'placeholder thing' is a property specific to textarea's and input
        tags.
      </p>

      <p><b>What is the var in JS ?</b></p>
      <p>
        That var thing is what JavaScript programmers use to tell the computer
        to create a 'variable'.Variables are like boxes with labels on them.<br>
        Since you are the programmer you are the one who decides what label to
        put on the box, but just like in my kitchen, it is very wise to have a
        label that matches what the box has in it.
      </p>
      <p><b> What is localStorage in JavaScript?</b></p>
      <p>
        JavaScript's local storage uses what techies call 'key-value pairs.'
        That's fancy talk for 'description-stuff pairs.' If you've ever seen an
        old fashioned phone book you've seen this in action.<br> The 'key' would be
        the name of the person and the 'value' would be their address and phone
        number.
      </p>
      <p><b>Key-values in localStorage?</b></p>
      <p>
        The key-values this is similar to cache in php to store the details in
        the local system or in place we want. It is crucial for a site to
        remember the input the user had input and if it forgets the information
        it will be useless.

      <h2>Mobile Master UX</h2>
      <p>Things to remember :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mobile use has been increased rapidly and became more accessible and a
          necessity for many since the iPhone came out.This rapid increase in
          internet accessibility has an impact on how we make websites now.
        </li>
        <li>
          People use mobile in mobility more than laptops they walk around with
          their mobile in hand rather than laptops.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building the site from smallest screen like mobile with low bandwidth
          and specs in mind can help our website be more responsive in the
          biggers screens and more over the core functionalites remain when the
          website is scaled up to bigger screens.
        </li>

        <li>
          Always optimise the content in the site using compressions of data
          like pictures, video or even the code itself.
        </li>

        <li>
          Mobile is not a fad we will continue to have them for a long time.
        </li>
        <li>Be there ,Be useful,Be quick</li>
        <li>Keep it simple</li>

        <li>Be emphatic with the user</li>
        <li>Reachbility of screen realestate & Placement matters a lot</li>
        <li>
          Speed matters we don't want the user to wait for content and put more
          cognitive load to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not horde the user with advertisements use the ad space more wisely
          and in reserved manner because content matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Autofills or what ever makes the viewer experience fast in filling
          forms or searches is a plus for the website as they can have more ease
          of experience while navigating through their site or the purchases in
          a website.
