      <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 FOR THE REAL WORLD: Lesson 8 CSS3 Transforms and Transitions </h2>

      <p>
      ‚Ä¢ The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Transform : We can manipulate an element's appearance using transform functions. The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they're provided.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Translation : Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: Transforms & Older Browsers => Transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android upto 4.4.3, iOS8,and Blackberry 10.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ To make the aforementioned code work in IE9 and older mobile WebKit browsers. Include the following : -webkit-transform <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Scaling: The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in other words, the element's center will stay in the same place as its dimensions change.
       To change this default behavior, you can include the transform-origin property, which we'll be covering a bit later.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note that you shouldn't declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.<br>   
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Rotation : The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element's center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ We're rotating our span by ten degrees clockwise‚Äîadding to the effect of text that's just been dealt a powerful uppercut. We are declaring the rotation before the translate so that it's applied first‚Äîremember that transforms are applied in the order provided. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Skew : The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you'd expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Changing the Origin of the Transform : As we hinted at earlier, you can control the origin from which your transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin property.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ It has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default).<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: Choose Your Ordering Carefully : The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Transitions : Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they'll usually appear smoother. On mobile devices with limited computing power, this can be a lifesaver.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ To support older WebKit browsers, you need to include the -webkit- prefix for all of your transition properties. You may also need to specify the -webkit- prefixed forms of properties. For example, youre unable to animate transform in a browser that only understands -webkit-transform<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: Automatic Graceful Degradation : While transitions are supported in all modern browsers, the fact that they're declared separately from the properties that are changing means that those changes will still be apparent in older browsers without support for transitions.  <br>
      ‚Ä¢ The transition-timing-function Property : The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. Do you want your animation to start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance at an even keel, or some other variation?<br>
      ‚Ä¢ The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.  <br>
      ‚Ä¢ The transition Shorthand Property : With four transition properties and a vendor prefix, you could wind up with eight lines of CSS for a single transition. Fortunately, as with other properties such as border, there's a shorthand available. The transition property is shorthand for the four transition properties just described.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Multiple Transitions : The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call. For example, if we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Animations : Transitions animate elements over time; however, they're limited in what they can do. You can define starting and ending states, but there's no fine-grained control over any intermediate states. CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Keyframes : To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element's property declaration block. Animations in themselves don't do anything; in order to animate an element, you'll need to associate the animation with that element.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ To create an animation, use the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+. Include @-webkit-keyframes for all WebKit implementations followed by a name of your choosing, which will serve as the identifier for the animation. Then, you can specify your keyframes.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Do not quote the animation name.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Animation Properties : The animation properties, remembering that you will need two declarations for each property as the -webkit- prefix is still needed in WebKit browsers, are as follows: üëâanimation-name<br>
      ‚Ä¢ animation-timing-function : Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through. The value is generally an integer, but you can also use numbers with decimal points (in which case, the animation will end partway through an iteration), or the value infinite for endlessly repeating animations.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ animation-direction : When the animation iterates, it normally goes from the 0% to the 100% keyframe, jumping back to the 0% when it starts a new iteration (if the animation-iteration-count is greater than 1). This is the default or normal value for animation-direction. You can use the animation-direction property to change this behavior.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ animation-delay : The animation-delay property is used to define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation: üëâ animation-delay: 50ms;<br>
      ‚Ä¢ The animation-fill-mode property defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Warning: Be Careful with Naming : If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name. You want to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as forwards, running, or alternate. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è With transforms, transitions, and animations, our site is looking more dynamic. Remember the old maxim, though: just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Animations were aplenty on the Web in the late 90s; a lot of us remember flashing banners and scrolling marquees, and animated gifs were less entertaining than those that are popular today. <br>

      <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 FOR THE REAL WORLD: Lesson 12 Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop </h2>
      
      <p>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Canvas : With HTML5's Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.  <br>
      ‚Ä¢ This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Canvas was first developed by Apple. Since they already had a framework‚ÄîQuartz 2D‚Äîfor drawing in two-dimensional space, they went ahead and based many of the concepts of what woud come to be known as HTML5's canvas on that framework. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ Creating a canvas Element : The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page:<br>
       üëâ &lt;canvas&gt; Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas. &lt;/canvas&gt;<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: Why not set width and height using CSS? : You may be asking yourself, why not set the width and height via CSS? It's because the width and height attributes determine how large the canvas's coordinate system is.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ If we don't specify width and height, the canvas element will default to a width of 300 and a height of 150. If we set the width and height for a canvas only in CSS, the canvas element will be 300 by 150, and the CSS properties will simply determine how large the box is that displays the image.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: A Canvas Playground : We have created a separate file at The HTML5 Herald, canvas.html, for you to see the examples outlined in this chapter. At canvas.html there are seven different canvas elements, each demonstrating a different technique shown in this chapter.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: What about 3D? : WebGL is a new API for 3D graphics being managed by the Khronos Group, with a WebGL working group that includes Apple, Mozilla, Google, and Opera.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: The Canvas Coordinate System : As you may have gathered, the coordinate system in the canvas element is different from the Cartesian coordinate system you learned in math class. In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200)<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: Anonymous Functions : You may be asking yourself, ‚Äúwhat is that function statement that comes right before the call to img.onload?‚Äù It's an anonymous function. Anonymous functions are much like regular functions except, as you might guess, they are without names.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Drawing Other Shapes by Creating Paths : We're not limited to drawing rectangles‚Äîwe can draw any shape we can imagine! Unlike rectangles and squares, however, there's no built-in method for drawing circles or other shapes. To draw more interesting shapes, we must first lay out the path of the shape.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Saving Canvas Drawings : If we create an image programmatically using the Canvas API, but decide we'd like to have a local copy of our drawing, we can use the API's toDataURL method to save our drawing<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Drawing an Image to the Canvas : We can also draw images onto the canvas element. In this example, we'll be redrawing onto the canvas an image that already exists on the page.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Manipulating Images : Redrawing an image element from the page onto a canvas is fairly unexciting. It's really no different from using an img element. Where it does become interesting is how we can manipulate an image after we've drawn it into the canvas.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Note: Getting Better Performance : You may notice a difference between the code sample used in converting an image to black and white, and the code sample for converting a video. In the video conversion, we've created another variable, pixelData, which stores the array of pixels in it. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è Displaying Text on the Canvas : If we were to view The HTML5 Herald from a file on a computer, we'd encounter security errors in Firefox and Chrome when trying to manipulate an entire video, as we did with a simple image. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ ‚û°Ô∏è SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ Note: What's XML? XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it's a markup metalanguage. In plain English, it's a system meant to annotate text. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ Drawing in SVG : Drawing a circle in SVG is arguably easier than drawing a circle with canvas. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ The viewBox attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the SVG image.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ The circle element defines a circle, with cx and cy the X and Y coordinates of the center of the circle. The radius is represented by r, while fill defines the fill style.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ SVG Filters : To make our progress spinner match our page a bit better, we can use a filter in Inkscape to make it black and white. Start by opening the file in Inkscape, then choose Filters > Color > Moonarize.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Canvas versus SVG : Now that we've learned about canvas and SVG, you may be asking yourself which is the right one to use? The answer is: it depends on what you're doing.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Drag and Drop : We've spent quite a bit of time this chapter focusing on drawing with code. Let's shift gears a little now and look at an API we can use to add some fun user interaction to our website, the Drag and Drop API.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ üí¢ Important: draggable is not Boolean! : Note that draggable is not a Boolean attribute, so you have to explicitly set it to true.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ The DataTransfer Object : DataTransfer objects are one type of object outlined in the Drag and Drop API. These objects allow us to set and get data about the elements that are being dragged. <br>
      ‚Ä¢ Accepting Dropped Elements : Now our mouse images are set up to be dragged. Yet, when we try to drag them around, we're unable to drop them anywhere‚Äîwhich is no fun.<br>
